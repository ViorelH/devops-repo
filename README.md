In this lab, I learned how to use Google Cloud tools to create a simple and automated continuous integration pipeline. 

I used Cloud Source repositories to create a Git repository, and then used Cloud Build and triggers to automate the creation of my Docker images when code was checked into that repo. 

When Cloud Build created my Docker images, it stored them in Artifact Registry. 

I tested how to access those images and test them in a Compute Engine VM.
